## Project Manager

A full stack project management system written in ASP.NET Core and ReactJS

Written as a learning tool for React Router and other parts of the ReactJS API as well as .net core,
the app contains full CRUD functionality along with basic form validation, AJAX calls to the server based API using fetch,
routing to different components with React Router

## Possible TODO

In the future, the app could be expanded to deal with validation and more complex business logic such as projects not being completed
unless all issues and tasks are closed, only project managers can be assigned to projects, developers to tasks and issues etc..
